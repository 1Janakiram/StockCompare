# StockCompare
A Flask-based web app that lets users register, log in, and compare two stocks. It fetches data using Yahoo Finance and Alphawave APIs, displays price trends via graphs, and shows detailed stock info side by side. Uses Flask-Session, CS50 SQL, and Matplotlib for backend and visualization.
